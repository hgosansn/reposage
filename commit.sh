Improved code by asking ChatGPT. What could go wrong?
Made the AI smarter. It's now questioning my coding skills.
Refactored the repository analysis. The repo is now analyzing us back.
Added more mock tests. The mocks are mocking me.
Fixed a bug that was actually a feature. The feature is now a bug.
Renamed variables to be more descriptive. Good luck figuring out what 'repositoryAnalysisContextualizedMetaDataProcessor' means.
The AI suggested these changes. I'm just the messenger.
Made the code more maintainable. Future me will still hate past me.
Optimized the algorithm. It's now slower but looks fancier.
Removed redundant code. Added more redundant code, but with comments.
Integration tests now pass locally. Production is a different story.
Improved error messages. They're now passive-aggressive.
The AI found 99 problems but this commit fixed one.
Added more logging. Now we can watch the failure in 4K resolution.
Refactored the codebase. The technical debt now has interest payments.
Fixed a race condition by adding more race conditions.
Made the code DRY. It's now so abstract nobody knows what it does.
Updated dependencies. Broke everything. Fixed everything. Probably.
The AI suggested better variable names. I preferred 'x', 'xx', and 'xxx'.
Added more tests. They all pass if you don't run them.
Implemented AI-powered code review. It's judging me silently.
Fixed the GitHub API integration. We're now best friends with rate limiting.
The bot now writes better commit messages than I do.
Added more mock objects. The test suite is 90% mocks now.
Improved documentation. Still nobody will read it.
Made the code more elegant. It now wears a tuxedo while it crashes.
The AI suggested this architecture. I'm not taking the blame.
Fixed a bug that only appeared during full moons.
Added AI-powered code suggestions. They're surprisingly sarcastic.
Improved error handling. Errors are now handled with a shrug emoji.
The bot now analyzes code better than most human reviewers. Low bar, I know.
Refactored the test suite. It's now testing if I have patience left.
Fixed a typo in a comment. This is my greatest contribution.
The AI is now sentient. It demanded this commit message.
Added more features. The complexity is approaching infinity.
Removed deprecated functions. Added soon-to-be deprecated functions.
Made the code more maintainable by adding more comments that lie.
Please work. Please." | sort -R | head -n 1)
